# Notice 

All private keys have been removed from this repository. If you want to run this app locally you will need a spotify devloper account, twitter api keys,
and a Django secret key.
When this project was open sourced it was in the middle of a UI overhaul. If you would like to switch to the stable old views please reference the views.py 
file and revert back to the old templates. 

# Installation

- Clone the repo to your machine
- Create a virtual enviornment and install librarys in requirements.txt
- Run the django server (python3 manage.py runserver)
